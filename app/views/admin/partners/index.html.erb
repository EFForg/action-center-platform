<h2>Partners</h2>

<p>If we are running a joint campaign, we’ll want to include the partner organization’s name on the action. Adding a partner here puts the name into our database so that they can be added to an action from a list. </p>

<h3>Partner signups</h3>

<p>In certain, very rare, situations, we might agree to let users subscribe to a partner organization’s email list from an action hosted by EFF. The partner organization’s name and privacy policy appears in an extra email signup box on the action. If a user opts in, they’ll be added as a “subscriber” on the partner’s page here in the action center.
You must have the Activism Director’s approval to add a partner email signup to a campaign, and a partner must be approved each time we agree to give them a signup option on any campaign. </p>
<p>“Edit Partner” will allow you to enter the information required for enabling partner signups. And then, you can enable partner signups. </p>

<h3>How partner organizations get their new subscriptions</h3>

<p>If a partner has been approved to have signups on an action, they will need an Action Center login to download their subscription list. Once they have an account, you can link it to the organization on the partner list on the “Edit Partner” page. This will give them a “Partner Dashboard” link once they login to the site, allowing them to view and download their new subscribers. </p>
