Dear $NAME,

**Thank you for taking action as part of our "[$TITLE]($URL)" campaign.**

For more than twenty years, EFF has been defending your rights to online free speech and privacy. Whether we're arguing for user rights in front of the Supreme Court, defending Internet users in international policy negotiations, or rallying online activists to combat dangerous legislation like SOPA, we couldn't do any of this without people like you committed to digital rights.

## Please support our work:

Want to help us continue our fight for online rights? Please consider a [donation of $10](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/thanks-supporting-our-fight-free-and-open-internet) or more. The majority of EFF's funding comes from individual members like you.

## Spread the word:

Will you take a moment to urge your friends to speak out as well?
